    <h4>First Lesson</h4>
    <p>During our first lesson I initialized the repository, 
        connected it to the GitHub and started working on my 
        first website.</p>
    <h3>Homework</h3>
    <p>At home I watched the videos all over again, took notes 
        and worked on my website. Finally I tried to upload my 
        homework to the LMS</p>
